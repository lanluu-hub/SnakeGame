# SnakeGame
SnakeGame is a classic console-based Snake game implemented in C++. Inspired by the GeeksforGeeks tutorial, the game features real-time movement, food consumption, score tracking, and collision detection .

## Features
- Navigate the snake using W, A, S, D keys.

- Eat food (#) to grow longer and earn points (+10 per item).

- Game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own tail.

- Dynamic console rendering of the snake, food, walls, and score 


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, or MSVC).

- Windows-specific headers (<conio.h>, <windows.h>) are used, so the game is currently best supported on Windows systems.

### Installation
1. Clone your GitHub repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SnakeGame.git
```


2. Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd SnakeGame
```


## How to Run
Compile and run with your preferred compiler:
```bash
g++ SnakeGame.cpp -o SnakeGame
./SnakeGame
```

On Windows systems:
```bash
cl SnakeGame.cpp
SnakeGame.exe
```
Follow the on-screen prompts:

1. Enter your name.

2. Choose difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard).

3. Use W/A/S/D to move and consume food.

## Gameplay
- Avoid: Walls and your own tail.

- Collect: Food items to grow and increase your score.

- Challenge: As the snake grows longer, maneuvering becomes more difficult.
